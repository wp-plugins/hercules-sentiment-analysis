Hercules Sentiment Analysis uses PHP Insight (https://github.com/JWHennessey/phpInsight) to determine whether comments, posts, and post titles
are positive, negative, or neutral.  This will help bloggers respond to readers who have concerns faster (or delete negative comments if necessary),
as well as know what sentiment they are portraying with their post titles and content.
